        <h3>Accomplishments</h3>
        <ul id="accomplishments">
            <li>Took lead on a major product when the previous lead developer left the company. Was able to learn and then improve upon the product with little previous knowledge of it. Reworked the product to use Entity Framework away from dynamic SQL with DataTables and little sense of Object Oriented practices. Changed web pages over to use a Master Page approach that allows for much more flexibility in the style of the website. Added Unit Testing to create a more stable and reliable product. I am also passionate about security, always striving to keep up to date on the latest threats and news. I moved the product I work on away from insecure password storage and comparison to a more secure encryption technique using salted and hashed passwords. I have listened to every episode of the Security Now! podcast, in an effort to remain on top of the latest security news while furthering my knowledge of security methods and techniques. Pushed for and successfully helped the company transition to using Team Foundation Server for source control when it was previously not using any source control. Started and lead a monthly learning meeting for other developers to encourage growth and standards across projects. Created a monthly lunch and learn meeting for the entire company to come together and hear about new product features, procedures that are going to be implemented, or knowledge that fundamental to all of the company’s products. Organized company events to team build and just have fun together: poker night, LAN party, pizza day.</li>
